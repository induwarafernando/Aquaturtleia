            They are named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells.<br><br>

          Green turtles are primarily found in tropical and subtropical waters.
          They migrate long distances between their feeding grounds and the beaches where they were born.Like other sea turtles, they undertake these migrations for survival.<br><br><br>
      
          Conservation Status and Threats:<br><br>
      
          Green turtles are classified as endangered.
          They face various threats, including overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, and being caught in fishing gear.
          Loss of nesting beach sites also poses a significant risk to their survival.</p>

           <p>Olive Ridley turtles are one of the smallest sea turtle species.
             <br><br>
             They get their name from the olive-green color of their shells.
             <br><br>
             Found in Sri Lanka's coastal areas, they are known for their mass nesting events called arribadas.<br><br>

        <div class="hikka-visit">

         <p>Habitat and Behavior:<br>
          Olive Ridley turtles are widely distributed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including the coastal areas of Sri Lanka.
          They are known for their synchronized mass nesting events called arribadas, where large numbers of females come ashore to lay their eggs on sandy beaches.
          These turtles are primarily oceanic and have a preference for warm, tropical waters.
          <br><br>
          
          Conservation Status and Threats:<br>
          Olive Ridley turtles are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).<br>
          Nesting Beach Loss: Destruction and degradation of nesting beaches due to coastal development, erosion, and pollution reduce suitable nesting habitats for these turtles.<br>
          Egg Harvesting: The collection of Olive Ridley turtle eggs for consumption or trade poses a significant threat to their population.</p>

           <p>Loggerhead turtles are known for their relatively large heads and powerful jaws.<br><br>
            Their shells are typically reddish-brown in color.<br><br>
            Found in Sri Lanka's waters, they undertake long migrations and feed on a variety of marine organisms.<br><br>
            These turtles have a relatively slow growth rate and reach sexual maturity between the ages of 20 and 30 years.

          They prefer coastal and offshore waters and can often be seen in coral reefs, bays, and estuaries.
          Loggerheads are known for their large heads and powerful jaws, which they use to feed on a diet consisting mainly of bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crabs and mollusks.<br><br><br>
      
          Conservation Status and Threats:<br><br>
      
          Sri Lanka has implemented various conservation measures to protect loggerhead turtles and their nesting sites.</p>

           <p>Leatherback turtles are the largest of all sea turtles.<br><br>
            They have a unique leathery shell instead of a hard shell like other turtles.<br><br>
            Found in Sri Lanka's coastal regions, they are known for their deep dives and ability to travel long distances.</div>

         <p>Habitat and Behavior:<br><br>

          They are known for their ability to tolerate colder waters compared to other sea turtle species.
          Leatherbacks have a unique physiology with a leathery shell and a large size, making them the largest of all sea turtles.
          Leatherbacks primarily feed on jellyfish, using their specialized jaws to consume their gelatinous prey.<br><br>
      
          Conservation Status and Threats:<br><br>
    
          Coastal development and habitat degradation, including pollution and coastal lighting, can disorient hatchlings and nesting females.
          Climate change also poses a threat, as rising temperatures can affect nesting beaches and alter the sex ratios of hatchlings.</p>
